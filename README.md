# Movie-Time
A database management system that helps user reserve their seats for movie shows, and lets cinema halls track the status of all their seat bookings.

1. This system can be used by a cinema hall to display its shows, timings, ticket prices, remaining seats, etc.
2. Customers can reserve their seats through this system, and obtain a unique code on doing so. This code when shown at the time of entry can retrieve the entire booking information.
3. Once a reservation is made, the changes are reflected in the system, to ensure that multiple bookings cannot happen for the same seats.
